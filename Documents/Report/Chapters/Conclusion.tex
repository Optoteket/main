In this thesis work, a mathematical model for the given staff scheduling problem at the Library of Norrk√∂ping was developed. The model was run on the commercial optimization solver CPLEX, which generated an optimal schedule with three librarian stand-ins and zero assistant stand-ins at the worst day. This is better than the current schedule at the library, where only one staff member was assigned as stand-in on the worst day.

When developing the two heuristics for solving the problem, the conclusion was reached that the weekend distribution is essential for the stand-in distribution in the final schedule. The heuristic which focused on weekend scheduling separate from the rest of the problem thus performed better. It was also concluded that the problem is not very difficult to solve, however it is challenging to model. In order to find a more robust scheduler for the problem, which can adapt to changes in the work force, a better model must be developed.


% To CLaes: is it possible to focus on weekends using your implementation?
