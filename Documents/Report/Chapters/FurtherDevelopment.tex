For both of the heuristics the first step is to generalize the problem to ten weeks instead of five. In doing so, the heuristics will have the same time span as the AMPL implementation. Furthermore, if meetings are implemented and five-week separated work weeks look alike the heuristics will solve the same problem as the AMPL implementation. 

By looking at the results from the heuristics it deems possible to solve the complete problem by spending more time implementing. However, regardless if such results were reached it would only work for this specific library. A general solver would not be a feature that could be implemented. The reason is due to the uniqueness of requirements in the library. In case they were similar someone would, most likely, already have created a general solver for libraries or any other service institution.
