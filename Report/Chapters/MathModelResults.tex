\section{Evaluation of performance}

Running the mathematical model in CPLEX 12.5.0.0 finds an optimum solution in approximately 17 minutes (1031). In the objective function, the parameters L = 4000, A = 2000 and N = 5 were used, thus having twice as much priority on finding librarian stand-ins than assistant stand-ins.

Other parameters include:

\begin{itemize}
\item the number of allowed PL per week, which was one
\item the number of allowed PL in 10 weeks, which was three
\item the number of tasks which can be placed on the same shift time during a week, which was two
\end{itemize}

%Solution time: 
%Objective function parameters chosen: L = 4000, A = 2000, N = 5
%Constraint parameters: num_PL_week = 1,num_PL_week_10_weeks = 3, num_shifts_per_time = 2
