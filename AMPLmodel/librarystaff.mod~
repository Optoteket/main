### Sets ###
set D; #Set of days in a week
set W; #Set of weeks
set I; #Set of staff
set S{D}; #Set of outer shifts in a day, either weekday or weekend day
set J{D}; #Set of total outer task types at a day D
#set I_qualified{J}; #Set of qualified workers for task type J
set I_weekend_avail; #Set of workers available for weekend work. Subset of I
#set I_weekend{W}; #Set of workers available on weekend w. Subset of I_weekend_avail
set I_lib; #Set of librarians
set I_ass; #Set of assistants
set V; #Set of possible week rotations (shift the week by 1..5 steps)


### Parameters ###
param skill{I}; #Staff skill competence for worker i, 0 if Assistant or 1 if Librarian
param avail{i in I, w in W, d in D, s in S[d]} binary; #Worker i available for shift s day d week w
#param inner{I,D,W} binary; #saying if worker i has inner service day d week w
param task_worker_demand{d in D, s in S[d], j in J[d]} integer; #number of workers required for task type j shift s on day d
param qualavail{i in I,w in W, d in D, s in S[d], j in J[d]} binary; #Worker i qualified and available for task type j shift s day d week w
#param meeting{S{D},D,W} binary;

### Variables ###
var x{i in I, w in W, d in D, s in S[d], j in J[d]} binary; #1 if worker i is assigned task type j in shift s day d week w
var y{i in I, w in W, d in D} binary; #1 if worker i used day d in week w
var lowest_stand_in_amount integer; # Lowest number of stand-in workers at any shift
var h{i in I_weekend_avail, w in W} binary; #1 if worker i works weekend in week w
var z{i in I_weekend_avail, w in W, d in D, s in S[d], j in J[d]} binary; #1 if x = 1 and h = 1, 0 else
